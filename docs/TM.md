## Season Overview

A CSC season is split into multiple important periods. The big 4 important ones are Offseason, Preseason, Regular Season, and Playoffs.

### Offseason

The offseason is arguably the most complex period of time for transactions. The offseason itself can be split into 4 sections, being the offseason break, early transactions window, offseason transactions window, and the draft. Only the latter 3 are time periods in which TMs are heavily needed to do transactions. The offseason break is the actual period in which there are no primary league functions being run, and is the break between seasons.
> TM head note: 24h after the last match day, the season is officially over. Make sure to remove all promotes and IR's, and remind admins to tick all contracts forward by one.

> TM head note: Remind GMs to post cut notes for players wishing to explore free agency during the offseason break. This is to provide transparency and not run into any issues with unintentional poaching. 

#### Early Transactions Window
During the combines, there is an "early" transactions window. The specific dates will be specified by the admins. The early transactions window is to provide an early period for GMs to resign and cut contracts before the normal transactions window. This is mostly for the ease of both GMs and TMs.
Some things to keep in mind...
* Teams cannot resign then cut players, resigned players will have 2md protections (counting preseason matches)
* Teams only have to resign players if their contract is 0
* Teams do not have to cut players if their contract is 0, admins should eventually remove them. 
* Only resigns and cuts are allowed, no promotes either.

> TM head note: Remind admins to run the expiring players command to notify teams of expiring contracts.
